# GNEWS_ANNOYANCE_REMOVER

Chrome extension and a work in progress

Auto-remove onload articles with a list of keywords saved in a cookie and temporary list updated in a draggable/resizeable textbox, and  
keep articles from sources listed in an approved, cookie saved list - so if you start gnews, nothing's approved but you can "Add To Safe List" button.

TODO: Temp keywords are cookied but still need a method to add permanent keyword storage.

Made this for my own use, I don't publish extension so feel free to do what you like with it
