# GNEWS_ANNOYANCE_REMOVER

Chrome extension and a work in progress

Methods to remove garbage news using keywords (in a cookie) and a method to minimalize and junk news sources (also removes tracking - every hover is tracked).  It's really a webpack crap site with no worthwhile user interaction.  I've parred it down to keeping a list of safe sites and minimizing junk (for now).  I currently have over 2000 "Hide all stories from -" sites (had automated it) and still the junk keeps rolling in.

My 2 bits: News sources are desperate and have become little more than ridiculous, overpriced click bait.  Even if you subscribe they still make every effort to "afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted" to keep you paying.  I think AI (automated web scraping) will eventually provide summarized articles manipulated enough to seem original and give you the option to pay a few cents per extended read.

Made this for my own use, I don't publish extension so feel free to do what you like with it
