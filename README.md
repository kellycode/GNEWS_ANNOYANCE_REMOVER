Google seems to have an agreement with news providers that lets them show news as long as they show news from everywhere regardless of user prefs.  And, lately, they seem to be ignoring the "Hide all stories from" list.

This is brute force remove google news garbage.  Cookie and local storage stored keyword article remover by subject and source.  Hovering over a news source displays a "X" box that, when clicked, adds this provider to the junk list ("Temp" atm) and then scans and deletes news from that provider.
When a "c-wiz" box is empty of news from providersm that box is also removed.

Chrome extension and a work in progress

Note: "Perm" tab is for a planned feature add and not used atm

Made this for my own use, I don't publish extension so feel free to do what you like with it
