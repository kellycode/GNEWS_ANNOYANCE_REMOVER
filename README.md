# GNEWS_ANNOYANCE_REMOVER

Methods to remove garbage news using keywords (in a cookie) and working on a method to remove content and tracking from junk news sources.  It's really a webpack crap site with no worthwhile user interaction.  I've parred it down to keeping a list of safe sites and minimizing junk (for now).  I currently have over 2000 "Hide all stories from -" sites (had automated it) and still the junk keeps rolling in.

My 2 bits: News sources are desperate and have become little more than ridiculous click bait.  Even if you subscribe they still make every effort to "afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted" to keep you paying.  I think AI (automated web scraping) will eventually provide "custom" articles manipulated enough to seem original and charge a few cents per read.

Made this for my own use, feel free to do what you like with it
